## About

Homunculus is a Node.js module that allows you to interact with the virtual world
[Second Life](https://www.secondlife.com), utilizing the official
[Second Life UDP protocol](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Protocol).

Homunculus has been made possible thanks to these wonderful resources:

- [node-omv](https://bitbucket.org/Wolfspirit/node-omv) by Wolfspirit for their proof of concept
- [pyogp](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/PyOGP) by the late Enus Linden and their team
- [libopenmetaverse](https://github.com/openmetaversefoundation/libopenmetaverse) for kicking off the open-source "metaverse" community

Homunculus _is not affiliated with or sponsored by Linden Research, Linden Lab or
