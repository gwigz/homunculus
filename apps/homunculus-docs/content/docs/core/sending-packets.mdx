## Sending Packets

Currently there aren't much in terms of "sugar" for features. For now if something is missing, you can use the `await client.send([packet])` method to send various packets.

You can find packets in the `packets` export.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { packets } from "@gwigz/homunculus-core"

packets.ejec
//          ^|
```

### Validation

Packets are sent with minimal validation. The serializer only throws an error if it cannot serialize the packet. Otherwise, packets are sent as-is, and the server will typically ignore any invalid packets.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrorValidation
import { Client } from "@gwigz/homunculus-core"

const client = new Client()

// ---cut---
import { packets } from "@gwigz/homunculus-core"

client.send([
  packets.ejectUser({
    data: { targetId: "f09c1bae-df16-4413-93d7-251ed92c6d9a" },
  }),
])
```

Note that ejecting a user is already implemented in the `Nearby` class.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { Client } from "@gwigz/homunculus-core"

const client = new Client()

// ---cut---
client.nearby.eject("f09c1bae-df16-4413-93d7-251ed92c6d9a")
```

### Reliable Packets

To ensure a packet is acknowledged by the server, use `await client.sendReliable([packet])`. This method should resolve quickly if the network is stable. However, you do not need to use reliable sending for every packetâ€”only when acknowledgment is required.

Reliable packets will:

- Retry up to 3 times if no acknowledgment is received, using the same sequence number to prevent duplicates
- Timeout after 5 seconds, if the server does not respond in that time, the promise will reject

## Examples

Optional values such as `agentData.agentId` [which many packets require](https://github.com/search?q=repo:secondlife/viewer+_PREHASH_AgentID&type=code) can be omitted, and the serializer will fill them in with defaults.

```ts twoslash
import { Client } from "@gwigz/homunculus-core"

const client = new Client()

// ---cut---
import { packets, UUID } from "@gwigz/homunculus-core"
import assert from "node:assert"

client.send([
  packets.soundTrigger({
    soundData: {
      soundId: "884f50ac-9a0b-5667-334f-78ce08f9402e",
      ownerId: UUID.zero,
      objectId: UUID.zero,
      parentId: UUID.zero,
      handle: client.region.handle,
      position: client.self.position,
      gain: 1,
    },
  }),
])
```

Now, as for how you'd figure out what the fields actually are, or their defaults, you'll want to check the [official viewers source code.](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer/blob/aeefc73129978f6f2c1ba8caaff2750eff2cfbb3/indra/newview/llviewermessage.cpp#L534)
