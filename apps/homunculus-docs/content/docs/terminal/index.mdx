Currently requires [environment values](https://github.com/gwigz/homunculus/blob/main/.env.example) for login credentials, a more complete built-in login form will come later.

```shell
npx @gwigz/homunculus-terminal

# or at a specific location
npx @gwigz/homunculus-terminal --start "uri:Hippo Hollow&128&128&2"

# also works with Bun (preferred method)
bunx @gwigz/homunculus-terminal
```

Use `/exit` or `/quit` to disconnect.
