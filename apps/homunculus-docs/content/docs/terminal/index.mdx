### Introduction

Homunculus Terminal is a minimal command line interface for interacting with Second Life.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **This client is a work in progress!**
>
> It is not intended for use yet, it only features basic chat functionality, teleporting and other features are not yet implemented.

### Basic Usage

Currently requires [environment values](https://github.com/gwigz/homunculus/blob/main/.env.example) for login credentials, a more complete built-in login form will come later.

```shell
npx @gwigz/homunculus-terminal

# or at a specific location
npx @gwigz/homunculus-terminal --start "uri:Hippo Hollow&128&128&2"

# also works with Bun (preferred method)
bunx @gwigz/homunculus-terminal
```

Use `/exit` or `/quit` to disconnect.
